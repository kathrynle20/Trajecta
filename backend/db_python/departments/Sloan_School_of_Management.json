The dearth of funding for translational medicine in the so-called &ldquo;Valley of Death&rdquo; can be attributed to several factors, but a common thread among them is increasing financial risks in the biopharma industry and greater uncertainty surrounding the economic, regulatory, and political environments within the biomedical ecosystem. Increasing risk and uncertainty inevitably leads to an outflow of capital as investors and other stakeholders seek more attractive opportunities in other industries.<br /><br />By applying financial techniques such as portfolio theory, securitization, and option pricing to biomedical contexts, more efficient funding structures can be developed to reduce financial risks, lower the cost of capital, and bring more life-saving therapies to patients faster.

Rather, the focus is on getting a closer understanding of the recent work by sociologists and sociologically-oriented organization theorists that investigates central questions in strategic management.

    "full_description": "<p>This course focuses on early-stage biotechnology companies, with particular emphasis on understanding the underlying science, technology, and disease targets—together with the application of novel business structures and financing methods—to facilitate drug discovery, clinical development, and greater patient access to new therapies.</p>\n<p>Current research is enhancing our understanding of the genetic, molecular, and cellular bases of many human diseases, and is leading to many new types of biotherapeutics that we will cover in this course, including recombinant therapeutic proteins; monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates; cancer immunotherapies, replacement cells and genetically engineered cells; and nucleic acid and gene therapies. Translating these discoveries into drugs and diagnostics increasingly requires the establishment of for-profit companies, but funding for early-stage development of novel therapies is becoming scarcer, especially for therapeutics for “rare” diseases that affect small populations. The dearth of funding for early-stage biotherapeutics companies in the so-called “Valley of Death” can be attributed to several factors, but a common thread is increasing financial risks in the biopharma industry and greater uncertainty surrounding the scientific, medical, economic, political, and academic environments within the biomedical ecosystem. Increasing risk and uncertainty inevitably leads to an outflow of capital as investors and other stakeholders seek more attractive opportunities in other industries.</p>\n<p>By applying financial techniques such as portfolio theory, securitization, and derivative securities to biomedical contexts, more efficient business and funding structures can be developed to reduce financial risks, lower the cost of capital, and bring more life-saving therapies to patients faster. Thus this course will also cover basic financial analysis for the life-sciences professional; the historical financial risks and returns of the biotech and pharmaceutical industries; the evaluation of the science and business potential as well as the mechanics of financing biotech startups; capital budgeting for biopharmaceutical companies; and applications of financial engineering in drug royalty investment companies, biomedical megafunds, drug approval swaps, and life sciences investment banking.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Please note: edX Inc. has recently entered into an <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2021/mit-harvard-transfer-edx-2u-0629\">agreement to transfer the edX platform to 2U, Inc</a>., which will continue to run the platform thereafter.

Increasing risk and uncertainty inevitably leads to an outflow of capital as investors and other stakeholders seek more attractive opportunities in other industries.</p>\n<p>By applying financial techniques such as portfolio theory, securitization, and derivative securities to biomedical contexts, more efficient business and funding structures can be developed to reduce financial risks, lower the cost of capital, and bring more life-saving therapies to patients faster. Thus this course will also cover basic financial analysis for the life-sciences professional; the historical financial risks and returns of the biotech and pharmaceutical industries; the evaluation of the science and business potential as well as the mechanics of financing biotech startups; capital budgeting for biopharmaceutical companies; and applications of financial engineering in drug royalty investment companies, biomedical megafunds, drug approval swaps, and life sciences investment banking.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Please note: edX Inc. has recently entered into an <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2021/mit-harvard-transfer-edx-2u-0629\">agreement to transfer the edX platform to 2U, Inc</a>., which will continue to run the platform thereafter.

Major topics include how the innovation process works; creating an organizational environment that rewards innovation and entrepreneurship; designing appropriate innovation processes (e.g. stage-gate, portfolio management); organizing to take advantage of internal and external sources of innovation; and structuring entrepreneurial and established organizations for effective innovation. The course examines how entrepreneurs can shape their firms so that they continuously build and commercialize valuable innovations.

    "short_description": "If you are an entrepreneur, one of your priorities, in addition to building your company, is ensuring you have enough money at the right times. Early Stage Capital will consider a broad range of questions that entrepreneurs deal with on this front, including the following: What should your strategy and your priorities be in raising early stage capital? What are the market norms and standards in structuring VC deals? What are the critical negotiating strategies and tactics? How will your company be valued? How can you obtain the optimal valuation for your new venture? What are the critical elements in the relationship between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs? How is the \"venture model\" evolving? Is it broken? What is the impact of Super Angels and micro VCs?\n\nThese are key questions that face all entrepreneurs in 2010, particularly first-time entrepreneurs. This course aims to prepare you for these decisions, as either a potential entrepreneur or venture capitalist. Using live interactions with leading figures in the venture finance community, most of the class sessions will analyze fundamental strategies of the venture-capital investment process and the critical importance of the relationship between entrepreneur and investor. As well, we will have a tactical focus on demystifying the legalities and jargon of the term sheet and the \"A round\" financing process. Significantly for 2010, we will also frequently consider the rapid and arguably fundamental change in VC today as the \"lean startup\" model threatens much of the traditional role and value of the venture investor.\n\n**Disclaimer:** The websites for this course and the materials they offer are provided for educational use only.

Using live interactions with leading figures in the venture finance community, most of the class sessions will analyze fundamental strategies of the venture-capital investment process and the critical importance of the relationship between entrepreneur and investor. As well, we will have a tactical focus on demystifying the legalities and jargon of the term sheet and the \"A round\" financing process. Significantly for 2010, we will also frequently consider the rapid and arguably fundamental change in VC today as the \"lean startup\" model threatens much of the traditional role and value of the venture investor.\n\n**Disclaimer:** The websites for this course and the materials they offer are provided for educational use only.

It then applies these rationales and lessons learned to current topics in Fintech and the response to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>The objectives of this course are to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify the goals of financial regulation and understand the conditions under which regulation would make the financial system safer and more efficient and when it could be counterproductive.</li>\n<li>Identify the precursors and vulnerabilities that give rise to financial crisis, including historical contexts, technological developments, and private sector responses to previous regulation.</li>\n<li>Understand the main tools currently in use to mitigate stand-alone risks in individual financial institutions as well as stability risks to the financial system as a whole and evaluate their effectiveness, noting unintended consequences.</li>\n<li>Apply the basic rationales and goals for regulation to technological financial innovations (e.g., fintech) and how the post-2008 reforms have influenced the ongoing responses to the financial implications of the COVID pandemic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Endorsements:</p>\n<p>“Understanding how financial regulation evolved following the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, and how it shaped the financial industry, is vital for regulators and for the financial practitioners they regulate. This course provides the underpinnings for a critical assessment, challenging us to think through how regulation needs to adapt to today’s challenges.”</p>\n<p>– Dr. Ben Bernanke, former chair of the Federal Reserve</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>This course proves that an online course can be even better than a course delivered in person. Laura Kodres' videos are brief, on point, and engaging. She is the ultimate expert on the theory and practice of financial regulation. You feel like you have access to a personal tutor, who appears whenever you want her to. – Zvi Bodie, Professor Emeritus at Boston University</p>\n<p>– Zvi Bodie, Professor Emeritus at Boston University</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\"I took the course in a traditional classroom setting and found it really useful and intellectually stimulating. I recommend this course not only for regulators/policymakers but also for those who, in financial institutions, have to live with and have constructive dialogue with them to produce a more effective regulatory framework.\"</p>\n<p>– Kazuki Tsuchiya – MIT Sloan MBA 2020 / Working for Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group in global business development</p>",

        "full_description": "<p>This course will provide the underpinning rationale for financial regulation and evaluate the post-Global Financial Crisis reforms in this light, noting adaptions that were required due to systemic nature of the crisis and the need to ensure private sector compliance. It then applies these rationales and lessons learned to current topics in Fintech and the response to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>The objectives of this course are to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify the goals of financial regulation and understand the conditions under which regulation would make the financial system safer and more efficient and when it could be counterproductive.</li>\n<li>Identify the precursors and vulnerabilities that give rise to financial crisis, including historical contexts, technological developments, and private sector responses to previous regulation.</li>\n<li>Understand the main tools currently in use to mitigate stand-alone risks in individual financial institutions as well as stability risks to the financial system as a whole and evaluate their effectiveness, noting unintended consequences.</li>\n<li>Apply the basic rationales and goals for regulation to technological financial innovations (e.g., fintech) and how the post-2008 reforms have influenced the ongoing responses to the financial implications of the COVID pandemic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>Endorsements:</p>\n<p>“Understanding how financial regulation evolved following the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, and how it shaped the financial industry, is vital for regulators and for the financial practitioners they regulate. This course provides the underpinnings for a critical assessment, challenging us to think through how regulation needs to adapt to today’s challenges.”</p>\n<p>– Dr. Ben Bernanke, former chair of the Federal Reserve</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>This course proves that an online course can be even better than a course delivered in person. Laura Kodres' videos are brief, on point, and engaging. She is the ultimate expert on the theory and practice of financial regulation. You feel like you have access to a personal tutor, who appears whenever you want her to. – Zvi Bodie, Professor Emeritus at Boston University</p>\n<p>– Zvi Bodie, Professor Emeritus at Boston University</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\"I took the course in a traditional classroom setting and found it really useful and intellectually stimulating. I recommend this course not only for regulators/policymakers but also for those who, in financial institutions, have to live with and have constructive dialogue with them to produce a more effective regulatory framework.\"</p>\n<p>– Kazuki Tsuchiya – MIT Sloan MBA 2020 / Working for Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group in global business development</p>",

Are you interested in what you can do to build a better work for yourself and the next generation? If we take the right actions, we can shape the future of work in ways that meet the needs of workers, families, and their economies and societies. To do so, we first have to understand how work is changing, how firms can prosper and support good jobs and careers, and how to update the policies, institutions, and practices governing the world of work. The goal of this course is to understand the relationship between new technologies, work and society and develop plans of action for improving the job and career opportunities for today and tomorrow's workforce. </p>\n<p>We'll start by looking at the challenges we face today and in the near future in regards to globalization and technology change, as well as the unique opportunities that they present. Then we will take a deep dive into the history of work and employment to understand how the it affects us today, as well as to look at solutions that worked well in response to similar problems. We'll look at the impact advances in technology are having across industries, and the ways in which these technologies are transforming the nature of human work and skills needed. We will explore ways in which we as a society can and should shape and catalyze these new technologies to complement and augment human work, rather than replace it. We'll also take you on a personal journey, where you will learn what employers expect in today's world of work--the skills, flexibility, and knowledge that are crucial for success in the contemporary workplace. We'll examine what has to happen in order for employers, workers, governments, and educators to come together to forge new policies, rules, and understandings for governing the world of work in the 21st century, and together as a class forge a <strong>new social contract of work</strong> as well as a personal action plan to implement it. </p>\n<p>Many colleagues and groups around the world share our deep concern for these issues and are studying how to address them in their specific settings. We invite each of you to join us and to share your insights and ideas about how we can make work, work better for all in the years ahead. In this spirit we will draw on our own expert group here--ourMIT Task Force on Work of the Future. Together we can make a difference for the next generation workforce, our economies, and our societies.</p>",

The main focus is on the acquisition of a set of powerful analytical tools which are critical for the development of a technology strategy as an integral part of business strategy. These tools can provide the framework for deciding which technologies to invest in, how to structure those investments and how to anticipate and respond to the behavior of competitors, suppliers, and customers. The course should be of particular interest to those interested in managing a business for which technology is likely to play a major role, and to those interested in consulting or venture capital.",

        "short_description": "This course provides a series of strategic frameworks for managing high-technology businesses. The emphasis throughout the course is on the development and application of conceptual models which clarify the interactions between competition, patterns of technological and market change, and the structure and development of organizational capabilities.\n\nThis is not a course in how to manage product or process development. The main focus is on the acquisition of a set of powerful analytical tools which are critical for the development of a technology strategy as an integral part of business strategy. These tools can provide the framework for deciding which technologies to invest in, how to structure those investments and how to anticipate and respond to the behavior of competitors, suppliers, and customers. The course should be of particular interest to those interested in managing a business for which technology is likely to play a major role, and to those interested in consulting or venture capital.",

We want you to know that you too can be the entrepreneur of your dreams.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Image source: <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fishing_with_cast-net_from_a_boat_near_Kozhikode_Beach.jpg\">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fishing_with_cast-net_from_a_boat_near_Kozhikode_Beach.jpg</a></p>",

Data is transforming business, social interactions, and the future of our society. In this course, you will learn how to use data and analytics to give an edge to your career and your life. We will examine real world examples of how analytics have been used to significantly improve a business or industry. These examples include Moneyball, eHarmony, the Framingham Heart Study, Twitter, IBM Watson, and Netflix. Through these examples and many more, we will teach you the following analytics methods: linear regression, logistic regression, trees, text analytics, clustering, visualization, and optimization. We will be using the statistical software R to build models and work with data. The contents of this course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding MIT class (The Analytics Edge). It is a challenging class, but it will enable you to apply analytics to real-world applications.</p>\n<p>The class will consist of lecture videos, which are broken into small pieces, usually between 4 and 8 minutes each. After each lecture piece, we will ask you a \"quick question\" to assess your understanding of the material. There will also be a recitation, in which one of the teaching assistants will go over the methods introduced with a new example and data set. Each week will have a homework assignment that involves working in R or LibreOffice with various data sets. (R is a free statistical and computing software environment we'll use in the course. See the Software FAQ below for more info). At the end of the class there will be a final exam, which will be similar to the homework assignments.</p>",

We will be using the statistical software R to build models and work with data. The contents of this course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding MIT class (The Analytics Edge). It is a challenging class, but it will enable you to apply analytics to real-world applications.</p>\n<p>The class will consist of lecture videos, which are broken into small pieces, usually between 4 and 8 minutes each. After each lecture piece, we will ask you a \"quick question\" to assess your understanding of the material. There will also be a recitation, in which one of the teaching assistants will go over the methods introduced with a new example and data set. Each week will have a homework assignment that involves working in R or LibreOffice with various data sets. (R is a free statistical and computing software environment we'll use in the course. See the Software FAQ below for more info). At the end of the class there will be a final exam, which will be similar to the homework assignments.</p>",
