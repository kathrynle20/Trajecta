During the second phase, each team conducts design optimization using structural analysis software, with their phase one prototype as a baseline.\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\n\nThis course is made possible thanks to a grant by the alumni sponsored Teaching and Education Enhancement Program (Class of '51 Fund for Excellence in Education, Class of '55 Fund for Excellence in Teaching, Class of '72 Fund for Educational Innovation).

        "short_description": "There is need for a rigorous, quantitative multidisciplinary design methodology that works with the non-quantitative and creative side of the design process in engineering systems. The goal of multidisciplinary systems design optimization is to create advanced and complex engineering systems that must be competitive not only in terms of performance, but also in terms of life-cycle value. The objective of the course is to present tools and methodologies for performing system optimization in a multidisciplinary design context. Focus will be equally strong on all three aspects of the problem: (i) the multidisciplinary character of engineering systems, (ii) design of these complex systems, and (iii) tools for optimization.",

A general theme is the technique of velocity field representation and modeling via source and vorticity fields, and via their sheet, filament, or point-singularity idealizations.</p>\n<p>The intent is to instill an intuitive feel for aerodynamic flowfield behavior, and to provide the basis of aerodynamic force analysis, drag decomposition, flow interference estimation, and many other important applications. A few computational methods are covered, primarily to give additional insight into flow behavior, and to identify the primary aerodynamic forces on maneuvering aircraft. A short overview of flight dynamics is also presented.</p>\n<p>Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edxdemo101/edx-demo/1038\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><strong>FAQ</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Is there a required textbook?</strong><br />\nYou do not need to buy a textbook. All material is included in the edX course and is viewable online. This includes a full textbook in PDF form. If you would like to buy a print copy of the textbook, a mail-order service will be provided.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I still register after the start date?</strong><br />\nYou can register at any time, but you will not get credit for any assignments that are past due.</p>\n<p><strong>How are grades assigned?</strong><br />\nGrades are made out of four parts: simple, multiple-choice \"Concept Questions \" completed during lectures; weekly homework assignments; and two exams, one at the midpoint and one at the end of the course.</p>\n<p><strong>How does this course use video? Do I need to watch the lectures live?</strong><br />\nVideo lectures as well as worked problems will be available and you can watch these at your leisure. Homework assignments and exams, however, will have due dates.</p>\n<p><strong>Will the text of the lectures be available?</strong><br />\nYes, transcripts of the course will be made available.</p>\n<p><strong>Will the material be made available to anyone registered for this course?</strong><br />\nYes, all the material will be made available to all students.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the prerequisites?</strong><br />\nThe student is expected to be well-versed in basic mechanics, vector calculus, and basic differential equations. Good familiarity with basic fluid mechanics concepts (pressure, density, velocity, stress, etc.) is expected, similar to the content in 16.101x (however, 16.101x is not a requirement). If you do not know these subjects beforehand, following the class material will be extremely difficult. We do not check students for prerequisites, so you are certainly allowed to try.</p>\n<p><strong>Who can register for this course?</strong><br />\nUnfortunately, learners from Iran, Sudan, Cuba and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course.

A general theme is the technique of velocity field representation and modeling via source and vorticity fields, and via their sheet, filament, or point-singularity idealizations.</p>\n<p>The intent is to instill an intuitive feel for aerodynamic flowfield behavior, and to provide the basis of aerodynamic force analysis, drag decomposition, flow interference estimation, and many other important applications. A few computational methods are covered, primarily to give additional insight into flow behavior, and to identify the primary aerodynamic forces on maneuvering aircraft. A short overview of flight dynamics is also presented.</p>\n<p>Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edxdemo101/edx-demo/1038\">Learn more</a>.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><strong>FAQ</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Is there a required textbook?</strong><br />\nYou do not need to buy a textbook. All material is included in the edX course and is viewable online. This includes a full textbook in PDF form. If you would like to buy a print copy of the textbook, a mail-order service will be provided.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I still register after the start date?</strong><br />\nYou can register at any time, but you will not get credit for any assignments that are past due.</p>\n<p><strong>How are grades assigned?</strong><br />\nGrades are made out of four parts: simple, multiple-choice \"Concept Questions \" completed during lectures; weekly homework assignments; and two exams, one at the midpoint and one at the end of the course.</p>\n<p><strong>How does this course use video? Do I need to watch the lectures live?</strong><br />\nVideo lectures as well as worked problems will be available and you can watch these at your leisure. Homework assignments and exams, however, will have due dates.</p>\n<p><strong>Will the text of the lectures be available?</strong><br />\nYes, transcripts of the course will be made available.</p>\n<p><strong>Will the material be made available to anyone registered for this course?</strong><br />\nYes, all the material will be made available to all students.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the prerequisites?</strong><br />\nThe student is expected to be well-versed in basic mechanics, vector calculus, and basic differential equations. Good familiarity with basic fluid mechanics concepts (pressure, density, velocity, stress, etc.) is expected, similar to the content in 16.101x (however, 16.101x is not a requirement). If you do not know these subjects beforehand, following the class material will be extremely difficult. We do not check students for prerequisites, so you are certainly allowed to try.</p>\n<p><strong>Who can register for this course?</strong><br />\nUnfortunately, learners from Iran, Sudan, Cuba and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course. Separately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application. We are deeply sorry the U.S. government has determined that we have to block these learners, and we are working diligently to rectify this situation as soon as possible.</p>",

    "short_description": "This is a class about applying autonomy to real-world systems. The overarching theme uniting the many different topics in this course will center around programming a cognitive robotic. This class takes the approach of introducing new reasoning techniques and ideas incrementally. We start with the current paradigm of programming you're likely familiar with, and evolve it over the semester—continually adding in new features and reasoning capabilities—ending with a robust, intelligent system. These techniques and topics will include algorithms for allowing a robot to: Monitor itself for potential problems (both observable and hidden), scheduling tasks in time, coming up with novel plans to achieve desired goals over time, dealing with the continuous world, collaborating with other (autonomous) agents, dealing with risk, and more.",

    "short_description": "In the past building prototypes of electronic components for new projects/products was limited to using protoboards and wirewrap. Manufacturing a printed-circuit-board was limited to final production, where mistakes in the implementation meant physically cutting traces on the board and adding wire jumpers - the final products would have these fixes on them! Today that is no longer the case, while you will still cut traces and use jumpers when debugging a board, manufacturing a new final version without the errors is a simple and relatively inexpensive task. For that matter, manufacturing a prototype printed circuit board which you know is likely to have errors but which will get the design substantially closer to the final product than a protoboard setup is not only possible, but desirable. In this class, you'll learn to design, build, and debug printed-circuit-boards.",
