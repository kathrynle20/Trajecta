It introduces basic neuroanatomy, functional imaging techniques, and behavioral measures of cognition, and discusses methods by which inferences about the brain bases of cognition are made. We consider evidence from patients with neurological diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Balint's syndrome, amnesia, and focal lesions from stroke) and from normal human participants.",

Is it permissible to take one human life in order to save others? We have powerful and surprisingly rich and subtle intuitions to such questions.\n\nIn this class, you will learn how intuitions can be studied using formal analytical paradigms and behavioral experiments. Thursday evening, meet to learn about recent advances in theories of moral reasoning. Overnight, formulate a hypothesis about the structure of moral reasoning and design a questionnaire-based experiment to test this. Friday, present and select 1-2 proposals and collect data; we will then reconvene to analyze and discuss results and implications for the structure of the moral mind.\n\nThis course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the end of the month.",

The course combines lectures and hands-on experimental exercises and requires an independent experimental project. Some experience in programming is desirable. To foster improved writing and presentation skills in conducting and critiquing research in cognitive science, students are required to provide reports and give oral presentations of three team experiments. A fourth individually conducted experiment includes a proposal with revision, and concluding written and oral reports.",

    "short_description": "In this course, you will learn the basics of computational neuroscience via hands-on model building in Neuroblox and Julia. You will simulate models from the literature, from single neurons to large circuits with synaptic plasticity, and fit them to neural data. By the end of the course, you will be able to model your data, build your own custom circuit “blox” that may be incorporated into the Neuroblox library, and explore how interventions such as drugs and stimulation probes affect neural circuits.\n\nComputational neuroscience aims to simulate the brain *in silico*, from single synapses to brain-wide networks. The field has matured in tandem with experimental neuroscience, to the point where computational modeling has become an indispensable tool for understanding neuroscience data and motivating future experiments. However, building such models can involve a painstaking process of translating concepts from the literature into working code, then optimizing it to run in a reasonable timeframe.\n\nNeuroblox is a new software platform for computational neuroscience that aims to break down these barriers. It is based on the Julia programming language, built with simplicity, modularity, and performance in mind. It consists of a library of modular computational building blocks (“blox”) that can be easily assembled to simulate brain dynamics in code or via an easy-to-use graphical interface. Our tools bridge scales from spiking neurons to brain waves and fMRI, and have applications to neurology and psychiatry. Moreover, the behavior of multiple model variants can be compared to discriminate between competing hypotheses.\n\nTo learn more about computational neuroscience and the team's research, visit the [Laboratory for Computational Neurodiagnostics website](https://www.lcneuro.org/).\n\n**Course Audience:** Anyone interested in exploring how the brain works, including how it leads to cognition. \n\n**Course Prerequisites:** Prior coding experience is beneficial but not necessary.\n\n**Course Structure:** Brief presentation of background material, followed by hands-on exercises and open-ended challenges.",

Brainstem organization and functional components, including cranial nerve nuclei, ascending / descending pathways, amine-containing cells, structure and information flow in the cerebellar and vestibular systems. Distribution of the cranial nerves, resolution of their skeletal and branchial arch components. Functional divisions of the Diencephalon and Telencephalon. The course will then continue with how these various CNS pieces and parts work together. Motor systems, motor neurons and motor units, medial and lateral pathways, cortical versus cerebellar systems and their functional integration. The sensory systems, visual, auditory and somatosensory. Olfaction will be covered in the context of the limbic system, which will also include autonomic control and the Papez circuit.

During the course we will examine applications of several learning techniques in areas such as computer vision, computer graphics, database search and time-series analysis and prediction.

It includes sessions on anatomical, neurophysiological, and data acquisition and analysis techniques, and the ways these techniques are used to study nervous system function. Training is provided in the art of scientific writing with feedback designed to improve writing skills. Assignments include weekly preparation for lab sessions, two major research reports and a series of basic computer programming tutorials (MATLAB{{< sup \"®\" >}}). The class involves the use of experimental animals. Enrollment is limited.",
