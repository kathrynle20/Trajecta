What is the accuracy of a GPS position measurement? How fast should an airplane travel to minimize fuel consumption? The answers to all of these questions involve the derivative.\n\nBut what is the derivative? You will learn its mathematical notation, physical meaning, geometric interpretation, and be able to move fluently between these representations of the derivative. You will discover how to differentiate any function you can think up, and develop a powerful intuition to be able to sketch the graph of many functions. You will make linear and quadratic approximations of functions to simplify computations and gain intuition for system behavior. You will learn to maximize and minimize functions to optimize properties like cost, efficiency, energy, and power.\n\nThis course, in combination with Part 1, covers the AP* Calculus AB curriculum.\n\nThis course, in combination with Parts 1 and 3, covers the AP* Calculus BC curriculum.",

        "short_description": "Calculus Revisited is a series of videos and related resources that covers the materials normally found in freshman- and sophomore-level introductory mathematics courses. _Multivariable Calculus_ is the second course in the series, consisting of 26 videos, 4 Study Guides, and a set of Supplementary Notes. The series was first released in 1971 as a way for people to review the essentials of calculus. It is equally valuable for students who are learning calculus for the first time.\n\n**About the Instructor**\n\nHerb Gross has taught math as senior lecturer at MIT and was the founding math department chair at Bunker Hill Community College. He is the developer of the [Mathematics As A Second Language](http://www.mathasasecondlanguage.org/) website, providing arithmetic and algebra materials to elementary and middle school teachers.\n\n**Acknowledgements**\n\nFunding for this resource was provided by the [Gabriella and Paul Rosenbaum Foundation](http://www.rosenbaum-foundation.org/).\n\n### Other Resources by Herb Gross\n\n[Calculus Revisited: Single Variable Calculus](/courses/res-18-006-calculus-revisited-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/)\n\n[Calculus Revisited: Complex Variables, Differential Equations, and Linear Algebra](/courses/res-18-008-calculus-revisited-complex-variables-differential-equations-and-linear-algebra-fall-2011/)",

We will see some applications in combinatorics / number theory, like the Gauss circle problem, but mostly focus on applications in PDE, like the Calderon-Zygmund inequality for the Laplacian, and the Strichartz inequality for the Schrodinger equation. In the last part of the course, we study solutions to the linear and the non-linear Schrodinger equation. All through the course, we work on the craft of proving estimates.",

We will learn to shift our perspective to do calculus with parameterized curves and polar coordinates. And then we will dive deep into exploring the infinite to gain a deeper understanding and powerful descriptions of functions.\n\nHow does a computer make accurate computations? Absolute precision does not exist in the real world, and computers cannot handle infinitesimals or infinity. Fortunately, just as we approximate numbers using the decimal system, we can approximate functions using series of much simpler functions. These approximations provide a powerful framework for scientific computing and still give highly accurate results. They allow us to solve all sorts of engineering problems based on models of our world represented in the language of calculus.",
