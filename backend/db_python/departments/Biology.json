Students will learn (1) how to read, discuss, and critically evaluate scientific findings in the primary research literature, (2) how scientists experimentally approach fundamental issues in biology and medicine, (3) how recent findings have challenged the traditional “textbook” understanding of metabolism and given us new insight into cancer, and (4) how a local pharmaceutical company is developing therapeutics to target cancer metabolism in an effort to revolutionize cancer therapy.",

    "short_description": "Our brains are remarkably adaptable throughout our lives. Individual brain cells called neurons form synapses, sites of physical connection and communication between neurons, and then repeatedly rewire those connections in response to new experiences or to neuronal cell death caused by injury, disease, or aging. In this course, we will explore how neurons establish their synapses in the healthy brain during childhood and later in life, and how this process goes awry in disease states. More specifically, we will discuss how the brain forms its synapses early in life, stabilizes a subset of those synapses for long-term maintenance, and continues to add and remove synapses throughout life. We will then explore synapse dysfunction in diseases such as autism and Alzheimer’s disease, which involve abnormal increases or losses of synaptic connections, respectively. We will also consider synapse remodeling, a process of adding and removing synaptic connections to optimize our brain network, in the context of neuroinflammation, recovery from traumatic brain injury, and psychological trauma following prolonged stress.\n\nThis course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/current-students/subject-offerings/advanced-undergraduate-seminars/) offered by the Biology Department at MIT.

Building upon the concepts from biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology from our <a href=\"http://bit.ly/700xBio\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">7.00x Introductory Biology MOOC</a>, these genetics courses go to a new level of depth. How do we determine the content of genomes? What can allele frequencies tell us about the genetics of different populations? And why does this matter to human society?</p>\n<p>Professors Mary Gehring and Olivia Corradin will challenge you to expand your understanding of genetics. You will study the content of genomes, quantitative methods for studying traits, and the impact of genetics on population structures.</p>\n<p>We developed the 7.03x Genetics series with an emphasis on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Developing your scientific thinking skills including articulating hypotheses, designing experiments, performing thought experiments, and interpreting data.</li>\n<li>Using data based on real scientific experiments and highlighting the scientific process in assessments.</li>\n<li>Demonstrating that biology is an active field that changes daily through examples of research and relevance to medicine, not static information in a textbook.</li>\n<li>Uniting themes and principles that inform how scientists conduct and interpret research.</li>\n<li>Implementing the science of learning in the course design.</li>\n</ul>",

As cells differentiate, distinct sets of genes must be coordinately activated and repressed, ultimately leading to a cell-type specific pattern of gene expression and a particular cell fate. In eukaryotic organisms, DNA is packaged in a complex protein super structure known as chromatin. Modification and reorganization of chromatin play a critical role in coordinating the cell-type specific gene expression programs that are required as a cell transitions from a pluripotent stem cell to a fully differentiated cell type. Epigenetics refers to such heritable changes that occur in chromatin without altering the primary DNA sequence. This class will focus on the role of epigenetic regulation with respect to developmental fate and also consider the fact that the epigenetic mechanisms discussed have broad implications, including how seemingly normal cells can be transformed into cancerous cells.\n\nThis course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/current-students/subject-offerings/advanced-undergraduate-seminars/) offered by the Biology Department at MIT.

Building upon the concepts from biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology from our <a href=\"http://bit.ly/700xBio\">7.00x Introductory Biology MOOC</a>, these genetics courses go to a new level of depth. What are different types of genetic changes? How do nature and scientists create these genetic variations? How do we design and perform analyses to identify the genetic basis of a trait or disease?</p>\n<p>Professors Peter Reddien and Mary Gehring will challenge you to expand your understanding of genetics. You will study the variety of genetic changes, different approaches to genetic analyses, and the impact of genetics on development and behavior.</p>\n<p>We developed the 7.03x Genetics series with an emphasis on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Developing your scientific thinking skills including articulating hypotheses, designing experiments, performing thought experiments, and interpreting data.</li>\n<li>Using data based on real scientific experiments and highlighting the scientific process in assessments.</li>\n<li>Asserting that biology is an active field that changes daily through examples of research and relevance to medicine, not static information in a textbook.</li>\n<li>Uniting themes and principles that inform how scientists conduct and interpret research.</li>\n<li>Implementing the science of learning in the course design.</li>\n</ul>",

Topics include genetics, cell biology, molecular biology, disease (infectious agents, inherited diseases and cancer), developmental biology, neurobiology and evolution.\n\nBiological function at the molecular level is particularly emphasized in all courses and covers the structure and regulation of genes, as well as, the structure and synthesis of proteins, how these molecules are integrated into cells, and how these cells are integrated into multicellular systems and organisms. In addition, each version of the subject has its own distinctive material.",

Do you know biology but do not understand how scientists really analyze complicated data? 7.QBWx: Quantitative Biology Workshop is designed to give learners exposure to the application of quantitative tools to analyze biological data at an introductory level. The Biology Department of MIT has run this workshop-style course as part of a one-week outreach program for students from other universities. With 7.QBWx, we can give more learners from around the world the chance to discover quantitative biology. We hope that this series of workshops encourages learners to explore new interests and take more biology and computational courses.</p>\n<p>We expect that learners from 7.00x Introduction to Biology - The Secret of Life or an equivalent course can complete this workshop-based course without a background in programming. The course content will introduce programming languages but will not teach any one language in a comprehensive manner. The content of each week varies. We want learners to have an introduction to multiple languages and tools to find a topic that they would want to explore more. We recommend that learners try to complete each week to find what interests them the most. </p>\n<p>This workshop includes activities on the following biological topics: population biology, biochemical equilibrium and kinetics, molecular modeling of enzymes, visual neuroscience, global and single-cell gene expression, development, and genomics. The tools and programming languages include MATLAB, PyMOL, Python, and R. This course does not require learners to download MATLAB. All MATLAB activities run and are graded within the edX platform. We do recommend that participants download a few other free tools for the activities so that they learn how to use the same tools and programs that scientists use.</p>\n<p><em>Workshop Content Creators and Residential Leaders</em></p>\n<p>Gregory Hale, Michael Goard, Ben Stinson, Kunle Demuren, Sara Gosline, Glenna Foight, Leyla Isik, Samir El-Boustani, Gerald Pho, and Rajeev Rikhye</p>\n<p><em>Residential Outreach Workshop Organizer and Creator</em></p>\n<p>Mandana Sassanfar</p>",

Do you know biology but do not understand how scientists really analyze complicated data? 7.QBWx: Quantitative Biology Workshop is designed to give learners exposure to the application of quantitative tools to analyze biological data at an introductory level. The Biology Department of MIT has run this workshop-style course as part of a one-week outreach program for students from other universities. With 7.QBWx, we can give more learners from around the world the chance to discover quantitative biology. We hope that this series of workshops encourages learners to explore new interests and take more biology and computational courses.</p>\n<p>We expect that learners from 7.00x Introduction to Biology - The Secret of Life or an equivalent course can complete this workshop-based course without a background in programming. The course content will introduce programming languages but will not teach any one language in a comprehensive manner. The content of each week varies. We want learners to have an introduction to multiple languages and tools to find a topic that they would want to explore more. We recommend that learners try to complete each week to find what interests them the most. </p>\n<p>This workshop includes activities on the following biological topics: population biology, biochemical equilibrium and kinetics, molecular modeling of enzymes, visual neuroscience, global and single-cell gene expression, development, and genomics. The tools and programming languages include MATLAB, PyMOL, Python, and R. This course does not require learners to download MATLAB. All MATLAB activities run and are graded within the edX platform. We do recommend that participants download a few other free tools for the activities so that they learn how to use the same tools and programs that scientists use.</p>\n<p><em>Workshop Content Creators and Residential Leaders</em></p>\n<p>Gregory Hale, Michael Goard, Ben Stinson, Kunle Demuren, Sara Gosline, Glenna Foight, Leyla Isik, Samir El-Boustani, Gerald Pho, and Rajeev Rikhye</p>\n<p><em>Residential Outreach Workshop Organizer and Creator</em></p>\n<p>Mandana Sassanfar</p>",
