A continuous process is conceived and designed as a steady-state operation. However, the process must start up, shut down, and operate in the event of disturbances, and so the time-varying behavior of the process should not be neglected. It is helpful to consider the operability of a process early in the design, when alternatives are still being compared.

    "short_description": "In this course you will learn the basics of photography and gain an intriguing new perspective into the visual world. We will begin with a gentle introduction to the tools, and after that, we start in earnest.\n\nAlthough we will emphasize photographing science and engineering, most of the material will easily apply to other kinds of macro photography. The course's video tutorials will be accompanied by assignments using a camera, a flatbed scanner, and mobile devices. You will discover how subtle changes in lighting, composition, and background contribute to creating more effective images. You will also learn to think graphically and present your photographs for journal figures, covers, and grant submissions. We will also host interviews with notable image makers and art directors. \n\nAbout the Instructor\n--------------------\n\n[Felice Frankel](http://www.felicefrankel.com/) is an award-winning science photographer and research scientist in the [Department of Chemical Engineering](https://cheme.mit.edu/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

        "short_description": "In this course you will learn the basics of photography and gain an intriguing new perspective into the visual world. We will begin with a gentle introduction to the tools, and after that, we start in earnest.\n\nAlthough we will emphasize photographing science and engineering, most of the material will easily apply to other kinds of macro photography. The course's video tutorials will be accompanied by assignments using a camera, a flatbed scanner, and mobile devices. You will discover how subtle changes in lighting, composition, and background contribute to creating more effective images. You will also learn to think graphically and present your photographs for journal figures, covers, and grant submissions. We will also host interviews with notable image makers and art directors. \n\nAbout the Instructor\n--------------------\n\n[Felice Frankel](http://www.felicefrankel.com/) is an award-winning science photographer and research scientist in the [Department of Chemical Engineering](https://cheme.mit.edu/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
