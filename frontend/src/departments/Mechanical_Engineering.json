The final phase of the class is a comparative analysis of the designs generated by the group.\n\nThis course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the end of the month.",

Along with learning mechanical skills, thinking both critically and visually, and working with different media, the students will consider how the arts grow out of and respond to particular cultural contexts and ideas; and how these thinking patterns can be applied to virtually all types of design.\n\nPresentations, lectures, demonstrations, discussions and various artistic works will be used to show students how other artists and designers have dealt with the same issues they will be facing in lab.  Each class will begin with a critique of the students' homework, followed by a discussion (and presentation when appropriate) of the pertinent issues of that week. All aspects of the course will aid the teams of students in designing and building a major inlaid tile whose elements are designed as digital solid models and manufactured on an abrasive waterjet machining center. The course will conclude with an exhibit of the completed tiles open to the MIT and the Greater-Boston public. Enrollment is limited to 16 students who will be divided into groups of 4 students each.

You will develop an understanding of seemingly opaque production lines with a particular emphasis on random disruptive events – their effects and how to deal with them, as well as inventory dynamics and management. </p>\n<p>Manufacturing systems are complex and require decision-making skills and analytical analysis. Managers and practitioners use a wide variety of methods to optimize the performance of manufacturing systems and control costs. The many processes and functions involved in building and maintaining these systems demand a high-level of knowledge. </p>\n<p>In this course, you will learn about these various methods and processes. We will start with a review of probability and statistics, and then cover topics in linear programming, queueing theory, inventory management and the Toyota Production System (TPS). Lastly, we will introduce stochastic manufacturing systems models developed here at MIT. </p>\n<p>The topics covered will provide the basis for learners to continue into the manufacturing field in such roles as an operations manager or supply chain manager. </p>\n<p>Develop the skills needed for competence and competitiveness in today’s manufacturing industry with the Principles of Manufacturing MicroMasters Credential, designed and delivered by MIT’s #1-ranked Mechanical Engineering department in the world. Learners who pass the 8 courses in the program will earn the MicroMasters Credential and qualify to apply to gain credit towards MIT’s Master of Engineering in Advanced Manufacturing &amp; Design program.</p>",

Topics will include; ship structural design concepts, effect of superstructures and dissimilar materials on primary strength, transverse shear stresses in the hull girder, and torsional strength among others. Failure mechanisms and design limit states will be developed for plate bending, column and panel buckling, panel ultimate strength, and plastic analysis. Matrix stiffness, grillage, and finite element analysis will be introduced. Design of a ship structure will be analyzed by \"hand\" with desktop computer tools and a final design project using current applications for structural design of a section will be accomplished.\n\nThis course was originally offered in Course 13 (Department of Ocean Engineering) as 13.122.

In MuSS, the engineering modeling, design principles, and fabrication processes of the components are fundamentally different. The challenge is to make these components so they are conceptually and model-wise compatible with other-scale components with which they interface. This course covers the fundamental properties of scales, design theories, modeling methods and manufacturing issues which must be addressed in these systems. Examples of MuSS include precision instruments, nanomanipulators, fiber optics, micro/nano-photonics, nanorobotics, MEMS (piezoelectric driven manipulators and optics), X-Ray telescopes and carbon nano-tube assemblies. Students master the materials through problem sets and a project literature critique.",

        "short_description": "Multi-scale systems (MuSS) consist of components from two or more length scales (nano, micro, meso, or macro-scales). In MuSS, the engineering modeling, design principles, and fabrication processes of the components are fundamentally different. The challenge is to make these components so they are conceptually and model-wise compatible with other-scale components with which they interface. This course covers the fundamental properties of scales, design theories, modeling methods and manufacturing issues which must be addressed in these systems. Examples of MuSS include precision instruments, nanomanipulators, fiber optics, micro/nano-photonics, nanorobotics, MEMS (piezoelectric driven manipulators and optics), X-Ray telescopes and carbon nano-tube assemblies. Students master the materials through problem sets and a project literature critique.",

The capstone project in this course is the Final Design Project in which each student designs a sailing yacht, complete in all major respects.\n\nThe central material for this subject is the content of the book _Principals of Yacht Design_ by Larssson and Eliasson (see further description in the [syllabus](/courses/2-996-sailing-yacht-design-13-734-fall-2003/pages/syllabus)). All the class lectures are based on the material in this book. The figures in the book which are shown in class (but not reproduced on this site), contain the essential material and their meaning is explained in detail during the lecture sessions.

    "short_description": "In this hands-on undergraduate class, students work in large teams of approximately 15-20 individuals to design and build working alpha prototypes of new products. The course is designed to emulate what engineers might experience as part of a design team in a modern product development firm. The large teams must work effectively to realize this task, so students also learn about group dynamics, team roles and management, consensus building, and the value of communication. \n\nEach year there is a broad theme which serves as a launching point for new product opportunities. At the end of the course, teams present their work to a live audience of ~1100 practicing product designers, entrepreneurs, academics, and classmates, as well as a significant live webcast audience—in the tens of thousands.\n\nKey Goals:\n\n*   To improve creative-thinking capability.\n*   To improve ability to identify significant product opportunities, and to develop appropriate solutions through a structured product development process.\n*   To improve expertise in constructing models for reasoning about design alternatives. These include estimations, sketches, sketch models, spreadsheets, geometric models, mockups, and prototypes.\n*   To improve engineering expertise and proficiency in techniques for building high-quality product models and prototypes.\n*   To learn about and experience structured methods for working in large teams on a project that requires teamwork to be successful.\n*   To improve presentation skills using a wide variety of media.\n*   To develop an understanding of, and enthusiasm for, the engineering activities involved with designing a new product.\n*   To develop an appreciation for the significance of societal contributions that can be made as a technological innovator.",

        "short_description": "In this hands-on undergraduate class, students work in large teams of approximately 15-20 individuals to design and build working alpha prototypes of new products. The course is designed to emulate what engineers might experience as part of a design team in a modern product development firm. The large teams must work effectively to realize this task, so students also learn about group dynamics, team roles and management, consensus building, and the value of communication. \n\nEach year there is a broad theme which serves as a launching point for new product opportunities. At the end of the course, teams present their work to a live audience of ~1100 practicing product designers, entrepreneurs, academics, and classmates, as well as a significant live webcast audience—in the tens of thousands.\n\nKey Goals:\n\n*   To improve creative-thinking capability.\n*   To improve ability to identify significant product opportunities, and to develop appropriate solutions through a structured product development process.\n*   To improve expertise in constructing models for reasoning about design alternatives. These include estimations, sketches, sketch models, spreadsheets, geometric models, mockups, and prototypes.\n*   To improve engineering expertise and proficiency in techniques for building high-quality product models and prototypes.\n*   To learn about and experience structured methods for working in large teams on a project that requires teamwork to be successful.\n*   To improve presentation skills using a wide variety of media.\n*   To develop an understanding of, and enthusiasm for, the engineering activities involved with designing a new product.\n*   To develop an appreciation for the significance of societal contributions that can be made as a technological innovator.",

Also covered are Seismo-Acoustic modeling of seabeds and ice covers, seismic interface and surface waves in a stratified seabed, Parabolic Equation and Coupled Mode approaches to propagation in range-dependent ocean waveguides, numerical modeling of target scattering and reverberation clutter in ocean waveguides, and ocean ambient noise modeling. Students develop propagation models using all the numerical approaches relevant to state-of-the-art acoustic research.\n\nThis course was originally offered in Course 13 (Department of Ocean Engineering) as 13.853. In 2005, ocean engineering subjects became part of Course 2 (Department of Mechanical Engineering), and this course was renumbered 2.068.",

With your help, this course will be a great learning experience exposing you to interesting material, challenging you to think deeply, and providing skills useful in professional practice. A major element of the course is design of a robot to participate in a challenge that changes from year to year. This year, the theme is cleaning up the planet as inspired by the movie _Wall-E_.\n\nFrom its beginnings in 1970, the 2.007 final project competition has grown into an Olympics of engineering.  See this [MIT News story](http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2011/timeline-2007-0209.html) for more background, a photo gallery, and videos about this course.",

These principles are reinforced via (1) hands-on laboratory experiences wherein students conduct experiments and disassemble machines and (2) a substantial design project wherein students model, design, fabricate and characterize a mechanical system that is relevant to a real world application. Students master the materials via problems sets that are directly related to, and coordinated with, the deliverables of their project. Student assessment is based upon mastery of the course materials and the student's ability to synthesize, model and fabricate a mechanical device subject to engineering constraints (e.g. cost and time/schedule).",

Steady-state, transient, and dynamic conditions are considered. Finite element methods and solution procedures for linear and nonlinear analyses are presented using largely physical arguments. The homework and a term project (for graduate students) involve use of the general purpose finite element analysis program [ADINA](http://www.adina.com/). Applications include finite element analyses, modeling of problems, and interpretation of numerical results.",

After an introduction to linear algebra and probability, it covers numerical methods relevant to mechanical engineering, including approximation (interpolation, least squares and statistical regression), integration, solution of linear and nonlinear equations, ordinary differential equations, and deterministic and probabilistic approaches. Examples are drawn from mechanical engineering disciplines, in particular from robotics, dynamics, and structural analysis. Assignments require MATLAB® programming.",
