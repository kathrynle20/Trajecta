        "short_description": "Many schools across the country are exploring competency-based education (CBE) as a pathway for transforming the school experience. In this course, instructor Justin Reich and the MIT Teaching Systems Lab team will help you develop an understanding of the characteristic elements of CBE and how schools are implementing it.\n\nYou will learn why so many educators are excited about CBE and its potential for closing opportunity gaps, as well as challenges and concerns. You will get a closer look at what the implementation of CBE looks and feels like for students, teachers, administrators, families, and community members. You will consider the kinds of system-wide shifts necessary to support this innovation in education.\n\nBy looking at research and hearing from experts and voices in schools, you will leave the course equipped to start or continue conversations about whether CBE is a good fit in your context.",

Alongside a group of accomplished peers, you’ll explore proven methodologies for idea generation, with emphasis on the engineering sphere, and learn how to recognize and frame inventive opportunities. You’ll additionally enhance your ability to identify potential roadblocks, analyze the strategic impact, and review and critique design concepts. </p>\n\n<h3 class=\"special\">Course Overview</h3>\n\n<p class=\"special\">This course may be taken individually or as a core course for the <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"46cca532-27df-48e3-a32d-71272988cba0\" href=\"http://professional.mit.edu/node/233\" target=\"_blank\">Professional Certificate Program in Innovation &amp; Technology</a>.</p>\n\n<p>How do you recognize a need for invention and nurture that into innovation within your organization? How can you develop your capacity to invent? Opportunities to invent are all around us, but it’s easy to miss them and hard to seize or capitalize on them. In this course, you will learn how to recognize, frame, and respond to these invention opportunities, as well as to create a healthy culture of invention.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of this course is to expose participants to the culture and methodology of the inventor, starting from the conviction that everyone can improve their ability to invent. </p>\n\n<p>We will focus on invention in an engineering context, although additional lessons will be drawn from other fields including science, the visual arts, architecture, and more. The class is taught by one of the founders of the field of 3D Printing, whose inventions in that field and in photovoltaics have led to seven start-up companies and three publicly-held companies.</p>\n\n<p>We will also discuss invention in the context of its role in competitive strategy and as a distinct and recurring aspect of innovation. Essential elements of Intellectual Property (IP) law and patent writing will be taught and practiced. The relative roles of patents and trade secrets will be reviewed, especially in view of current challenges in protecting IP.</p>\n\n<p>Human beings are born inventors, with a deep urge to explore. Formal education equips us with the ability to analyze. But invention requires both <em>synthesis </em>and analysis as well as an “artful” interplay between them. Invention therefore, must be relearned. Our goal is to have you feel the thrill of inventing and take it back to your workplace, feeling comfortable giving <em>yourself </em>a “license to invent.”</p>\n\n<h3>Participant Takeaways</h3>\n\n<section><ul><li>Understand the role of invention in innovation</li>\n\t<li>Internalize the distinct modes of thought embodied by synthesis and analysis and practice transitioning from one to the other and back again</li>\n\t<li>Gain facility with methodologies for idea generation and confidence in idea generation</li>\n\t<li>Gain facility with methodologies for analysis and learn when and where to apply analysis</li>\n\t<li>Develop the ability to think critically about Intellectual Property within a framework of competitive strategy</li>\n\t<li>Feel the thrill of inventing and be able to bring it back to the workplace</li>\n</ul></section><section><h3>Who Should Attend</h3>\n\n<p>This program is designed primarily for those working in industry, specifically mechanical, electrical, and materials science engineering. Executives, CTOs, and project managers in product design, Research &amp; Development, and manufacturing will benefit from attending this course. Anyone working on projects related to the Internet of Things are particularly well-suited to this course, as IoT is the intersection of the mechanical, electrical, materials, and information arenas.</p>\n\n<p>Start-ups live and thrive based on the impact of their inventions and those actively working in start-ups can make immediate use of the course, including in the classroom itself. (Prof. Sachs has participated in seven start-ups based on his inventions including as co-founder and CTO). Venture Capitalists and investors in Sci-Tech might gain insights into evaluating inventors and inventions. Policymakers looking for ways to frame R&amp;D projects will also benefit.</p>\n\n<p>As individual contributors, you will be able to make more inventive contributions to your projects because you will learn how to recognize an inventive opportunity and frame it. Additionally, you will understand how to initiate phases of exploration and synthesis, understand how to look for weaknesses by initiating phases of analysis, and understand when to move back and forth between synthesis and analysis. You will gain an understanding of how to analyze your individual contributions for strategic impact and be more active participants in design reviews and critiques.</p>\n\n<p>As managers, you will be able to foster a work environment that promotes inventive contribution by helping to frame the strategic needs which prompt seeking an inventive opportunity. You will be able to help people to overcome risk aversion and social pressure in ideation and invention, helping to direct the artful interplay of synthesis and analysis. You will know when to switch modes and how to integrate observations and results from the two modes, helping to set the right tone for design reviews and critiques. You will learn to set a tone where the outcome is what is valued by being able to apply objective criteria to evaluation and allowing for some level of depersonalization in the decision-making process.</p>\n\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n\n<p>A laptop or tablet with Word and Excel (or equivalents) is required for this course.</p>\n\n<h3>Program Outline</h3>\n\n<p>There are eight tracks in the course. Many of these topics will be revisited at several stages during the week.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Establishing context</strong>: The course will look at the role of invention in innovation, where innovation is understood to connote the complete and interacting sequence required to get a product to market. The touchstone of the course is to recognize that invention requires both synthesis and analysis as well as skill in moving back and forth between the synthetic and analytic frames of mind. The course aims to help participants understand the widely different roles and viewpoints of synthesis and analysis from the vantage point of different creative professions.  We will briefly examine the cognitive psychology and brain science that supports the existence of these two different modes of human thought, and their complimentary roles in making us creative, yet keeping us grounded.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Examples, deriving lessons</strong>: Participants will look at a  range of inventions by reviewing patents and reading accounts of inventive undertakings, in the words of inventors and through the eyes of third parties. The goal is to get a sense of the motivations and approaches of inventors and the diversity of circumstances surrounding and motivating invention.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Identifying inventive opportunity</strong>: As in any engineering endeavor, it is important to understand the needs that must be satisfied and the constraints on the solution. Participants will also learn how to identify and articulate opportunities for invention. For example, we will use the language of \"contradiction\" as articulated in TRIZ (see below), to formulate a problem in a way that is conducive to invention.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Synthesis</strong>: A main focus of the course will be on synthesis, especially on idea generation. We will study and practice formal methods including: brainstorming, morphological analysis, and TRIZ (also known as Invention Theory).

First, participants will recall and re-build their abilities to do order of magnitude estimation and first-order analysis, in order to be able to \"sanity check\" ideas. Participants will examine proposed solutions from the point of view of whether they are \"coupled\" or not, using the language and concepts of Axiomatic Design to appraise concepts and direct improvements. We will enumerate technology rules having to do with hierarchical design, platform definition, and subsystem definition.

The structure of a patent document will be examined with the focus on being able to read and interpret the essence of a patent: patent claims.

The course will look at the changing role of patents in the light of state-sponsored IP theft and discuss the trade-off between patents and trade-secrets.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Competitive strategy—projecting trends</strong>: It is essential to compare an idea against the competition—taking into account where the competition might be by the time your project goes to market.

Alongside a group of accomplished peers, you’ll explore proven methodologies for idea generation, with emphasis on the engineering sphere, and learn how to recognize and frame inventive opportunities. You’ll additionally enhance your ability to identify potential roadblocks, analyze the strategic impact, and review and critique design concepts. </p>\n\n<h3 class=\"special\">Course Overview</h3>\n\n<p class=\"special\">This course may be taken individually or as a core course for the <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"46cca532-27df-48e3-a32d-71272988cba0\" href=\"http://professional.mit.edu/node/233\" target=\"_blank\">Professional Certificate Program in Innovation &amp; Technology</a>.</p>\n\n<p>How do you recognize a need for invention and nurture that into innovation within your organization? How can you develop your capacity to invent? Opportunities to invent are all around us, but it’s easy to miss them and hard to seize or capitalize on them. In this course, you will learn how to recognize, frame, and respond to these invention opportunities, as well as to create a healthy culture of invention.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of this course is to expose participants to the culture and methodology of the inventor, starting from the conviction that everyone can improve their ability to invent. </p>\n\n<p>We will focus on invention in an engineering context, although additional lessons will be drawn from other fields including science, the visual arts, architecture, and more. The class is taught by one of the founders of the field of 3D Printing, whose inventions in that field and in photovoltaics have led to seven start-up companies and three publicly-held companies.</p>\n\n<p>We will also discuss invention in the context of its role in competitive strategy and as a distinct and recurring aspect of innovation. Essential elements of Intellectual Property (IP) law and patent writing will be taught and practiced. The relative roles of patents and trade secrets will be reviewed, especially in view of current challenges in protecting IP.</p>\n\n<p>Human beings are born inventors, with a deep urge to explore. Formal education equips us with the ability to analyze. But invention requires both <em>synthesis </em>and analysis as well as an “artful” interplay between them. Invention therefore, must be relearned. Our goal is to have you feel the thrill of inventing and take it back to your workplace, feeling comfortable giving <em>yourself </em>a “license to invent.”</p>\n\n<h3>Participant Takeaways</h3>\n\n<section><ul><li>Understand the role of invention in innovation</li>\n\t<li>Internalize the distinct modes of thought embodied by synthesis and analysis and practice transitioning from one to the other and back again</li>\n\t<li>Gain facility with methodologies for idea generation and confidence in idea generation</li>\n\t<li>Gain facility with methodologies for analysis and learn when and where to apply analysis</li>\n\t<li>Develop the ability to think critically about Intellectual Property within a framework of competitive strategy</li>\n\t<li>Feel the thrill of inventing and be able to bring it back to the workplace</li>\n</ul></section><section><h3>Who Should Attend</h3>\n\n<p>This program is designed primarily for those working in industry, specifically mechanical, electrical, and materials science engineering. Executives, CTOs, and project managers in product design, Research &amp; Development, and manufacturing will benefit from attending this course. Anyone working on projects related to the Internet of Things are particularly well-suited to this course, as IoT is the intersection of the mechanical, electrical, materials, and information arenas.</p>\n\n<p>Start-ups live and thrive based on the impact of their inventions and those actively working in start-ups can make immediate use of the course, including in the classroom itself. (Prof. Sachs has participated in seven start-ups based on his inventions including as co-founder and CTO). Venture Capitalists and investors in Sci-Tech might gain insights into evaluating inventors and inventions. Policymakers looking for ways to frame R&amp;D projects will also benefit.</p>\n\n<p>As individual contributors, you will be able to make more inventive contributions to your projects because you will learn how to recognize an inventive opportunity and frame it. Additionally, you will understand how to initiate phases of exploration and synthesis, understand how to look for weaknesses by initiating phases of analysis, and understand when to move back and forth between synthesis and analysis. You will gain an understanding of how to analyze your individual contributions for strategic impact and be more active participants in design reviews and critiques.</p>\n\n<p>As managers, you will be able to foster a work environment that promotes inventive contribution by helping to frame the strategic needs which prompt seeking an inventive opportunity. You will be able to help people to overcome risk aversion and social pressure in ideation and invention, helping to direct the artful interplay of synthesis and analysis. You will know when to switch modes and how to integrate observations and results from the two modes, helping to set the right tone for design reviews and critiques. You will learn to set a tone where the outcome is what is valued by being able to apply objective criteria to evaluation and allowing for some level of depersonalization in the decision-making process.</p>\n\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n\n<p>A laptop or tablet with Word and Excel (or equivalents) is required for this course.</p>\n\n<h3>Program Outline</h3>\n\n<p>There are eight tracks in the course. Many of these topics will be revisited at several stages during the week.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Establishing context</strong>: The course will look at the role of invention in innovation, where innovation is understood to connote the complete and interacting sequence required to get a product to market. The touchstone of the course is to recognize that invention requires both synthesis and analysis as well as skill in moving back and forth between the synthetic and analytic frames of mind. The course aims to help participants understand the widely different roles and viewpoints of synthesis and analysis from the vantage point of different creative professions.  We will briefly examine the cognitive psychology and brain science that supports the existence of these two different modes of human thought, and their complimentary roles in making us creative, yet keeping us grounded.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Examples, deriving lessons</strong>: Participants will look at a  range of inventions by reviewing patents and reading accounts of inventive undertakings, in the words of inventors and through the eyes of third parties.

Learners will be exposed to multiple points of view as the teaching team brings together scholars who have studied the topics from different disciplines. Learners will also learn how to work with visual evidence as primary sources to assemble arguments. </p>\n<p>For teachers, the course presents a number of units developed for the MIT Visualizing Cultures (VC) project. The instructors are the authors who created the VC resource, and the course provides a pathway into the VC website content. The VC website is widely taught in both secondary and college courses, and is the primary resource for this course. Educators can selectively pick modules that target needs in their classrooms; the course can be used in a “flipped” classroom where students are assigned modules as homework.</p>",

However, their access to information on how this system works is limited. Meanwhile, we increasingly understand that science and technology-based innovation is deeply connected to society's economic growth and its ability to generate societal wellbeing, so the public role of science is growing. This course will examine the public policy behind and the government's role in the science and technology innovation system. Given the challenges to future federal science support, this seminar will aim to equip those planning careers in and around science and technology with a basic background for involvement in science policymaking.\n\nThis course is offered during MIT's Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the end of the month. It features student-led discussion incorporated into the course structure as well as opportunities to interact with MIT students and faculty involved in aspects of science policy. The course has been offered since 2006 and has developed as a collaborative effort between the instructor and MIT students from the [Science Policy Initiative](http://web.mit.edu/spi/).",

Essa atividade exige um perfil motivador e organizado, capaz de fazer uma gestão eficaz, mantendo cronogramas, relações e responsabilidades sob controle. Nesse contexto, é necessário adaptar-se às teorias modernas de gestão de projetos nos mais variados setores em que são aplicadas. Nosso curso apresenta uma estrutura integrada que permite o êxito no planejamento e desenvolvimento de projetos em organizações, estabelecendo expectativas e compromissos realistas. Durante o ciclo de vida do projeto, os líderes precisam processar grandes quantidades de informações, realizando uma gestão baseada na coleta e organização de dados. Desde a definição dos requisitos, passando pela formação da equipe e o acompanhamento do progresso do projeto, até a conclusão do relatório com dados financeiro e de desempenho, o gestor do projeto pode sentir-se sobrecarregado e, por isso, é importante desenvolver ferramentas para estruturar essas tarefas. Neste novo curso, que conta com a reputação acadêmica do MIT, uma das principais instituições de pesquisa do mundo, os participantes desenvolverão a capacidade de elaborar e gerenciar projetos tecnológicos complexos. Os participantes irão adquirir as habilidades fundamentais de gestão de projetos para se tornarem líderes mais eficazes.</p>",

However, widespread adoption remains a challenge due to siloed efforts, limited AI fluency among leaders, and a lack of cross-functional alignment.\n\nMIT xPRO’s 12-week Applied AI in Healthcare: Innovation, Strategy, and Leadership program is designed to close this gap. This comprehensive learning experience empowers professionals to critically assess AI systems, understand real-world healthcare use cases, and craft strategies for leading AI-driven transformation across their organizations.\n\nDeveloped for leaders working at the intersection of healthcare, business, and technology, the program integrates two of MIT xPRO’s most respected offerings: Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: Fundamentals and Applications and the AI Strategy and Leadership Program: Thriving in the New World of AI. Through this combined curriculum, participants will gain the cross-disciplinary perspective, strategic insight, and leadership skills needed to navigate and shape the future of AI in healthcare.",

You do not have to be a radar engineer but it helps if you are interested in any of the following; electronics, amateur radio, physics, or electromagnetics. It is recommended that you have some familiarity with MATLAB®. Teams of three students will receive a radar kit and will attend a total of 5 sessions spanning topics from the fundamentals of radar to SAR imaging. Experiments will be performed each week as the radar kit is implemented. You will bring your radar kit into the field and perform additional experiments such as measuring the speed of passing cars or plotting the range of moving targets. A final SAR imaging contest will test your ability to form a SAR image of a target scene of your choice from around campus; the most detailed and most creative image wins.\n##### Acknowledgement and Disclaimer\n\nThis work is sponsored by the Department of the Air Force under Air Force Contract #FA8721-05-C-0002.

Under the instruction of two of the field’s pioneering experts, you’ll learn how to use your company’s data to increase the speed and quality of your decision-making, identify organizational problems, analyze behavioral metrics, and enhance company outcomes.</p>\n\n<h3>Course Overview</h3>\n\n<p>Born out of the MIT Media Lab, people analytics, using behavioral data to understand and manage organizations, has fundamentally changed how companies operate. This course will provide participants with a foundation in people analytics through discussion and hands-on exercises with real world data and tools. There are basic questions that have an impact on businesses that no one can answer. How much does the executive team communicate with engineering? Is a manager really spending time with their team? How often should a salesperson speak with a customer? The reason we can’t answer these questions is a lack of data. Surveys and consultants are useful, but their shortcomings are evident. They’re slow, subjective, and don’t actually measure what happens in the real world.</p>\n\n<p>New data has changed this equation. We are constantly generating data about our behavior: e-mail, IMs, calendar data, and increasingly sensor data about the real world. This is people analytics: using behavioral data about how people work to change how companies are managed. In this course, we’ll first investigate what data we have at our disposal now and in the near future. We’ll also discover what behavioral metrics really matter and how can you communicate these metrics to other stakeholders. Next, we’ll focus on how these new metrics and data streams can rapidly increase the speed and quality of decision making. Similar to A/B testing in the online space, now we can A/B test how businesses are managed. Compensation, IT systems, real estate decisions, and even org charts can now be rapidly deployed and quantitatively tested by combining behavioral data and key performance indicators (KPIs). We’ll discuss examples from Fortune 500 companies that have successfully used people analytics to improve their organizations, as well as how they are transitioning to an A/B testing decision making culture.</p>\n\n<h3>Participant Takeaways</h3>\n\n<ul><li>Understanding what behavioral data you already have</li>\n\t<li>Learning basic people analysis methods</li>\n\t<li>Identifying organizational problems that you can address with people analytics in the near term</li>\n\t<li>Understanding common roadblocks to implementing people analytics</li>\n\t<li>Learning the potential value of people analytics for your organization</li>\n</ul><h3>Who Should Attend</h3>\n\n<p>This course is ideal for directors, senior managers, executives, and business leaders in all industries who have (or want to have) responsibility for improving organizational performance.</p>\n\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n\n<p>Laptops are strongly recommended for this course.

    "full_description": "<p>This course examines and presents processes of designing and implementing land readjustment for urban development in the context of developing countries. The conventional approaches to land assembly for city expansion and renewal are often conflict-ridden. Land readjustment is an alternative land-assembly approach to government compulsory purchase (often referred to as eminent domain) and voluntary market transaction. In the land readjustment process, a public or private agency invites property owners to become stakeholders in a redevelopment project and to contribute their lands to the project as investment capital. In return, each property owner receives a land site of at least equal value in the vicinity of the original site upon project completion. Hence, the method discourages holdouts and minimizes massive relocation of existing residents.&nbsp; <br /><br />After all properties in the district are assembled, the project initiator can re-subdivide land sites and make space for wider roads and other local infrastructure. This approach therefore could reduce the initial capital requirement for compensating landowners during land acquisition for redevelopment.<br /><br />When applying land readjustment at the right time and in the right place, this approach could mediate a major hindrance of land redevelopment in countries that are facing rapid urbanization.</p>",

        "short_description": "Communities have always wrestled with the multiple purposes of education: to train young people for careers, vocations, and college; to prepare them for their roles as citizens; to develop habits of reflective, ethical adults; and to create a common experience in a pluralistic society while meeting the needs of individual learners. As the world changes and grows more complex, returning to these important questions of purpose can help guide schools in their growth and strategic change. To ensure our schools are effective, we need to routinely reimagine what the high school graduate of the future will need to know and be able to do. The artifact that communicates these ideas is called a graduate profile. Making explicit the capabilities, competencies, knowledge, and attitudes for secondary school graduates, and inviting key stakeholders like students and community members to be engaged in the process, can help you and your school to focus your vision of success and drive school innovation efforts.\n\nInstructor Justin Reich and the course team from the MIT Teaching Systems Lab look forward to guiding teachers, administrators, community members, and others passionate about improving secondary school in the process of designing a graduate profile. Over four weeks, you will reflect on the purpose and goals of secondary school, as well as desirable characteristics for graduates. You’ll learn how schools have benefited from a graduate profile development process and begin the process yourself.  You’ll learn more about your own context, its values and beliefs. You’ll leave the course with a shareable artifact that communicates a vision of a multi-faceted secondary school graduate.\n\nThis course has been authored by one or more members of the Faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Its educational objectives, methods, assessments, and the selection and presentation of its content are solely the responsibility of MIT.",

        "full_description": "<p>Explore how supply chain management concepts and methods can be applied within dynamic, resource-constrained contexts. In this course, you will learn how to professionally plan emergency operations that deliver essential goods and services to people affected by natural disaster, epidemic, pandemic, famine, armed conflict, complex emergency, and other humanitarian crises. Course topics are also foundational for understanding how international and economic development efforts support market resilience in meeting community needs during crisis.</p>\n<p>You will apply fundamental principles and analytical models to create timely, effective, and efficient supply chain plans. You will learn about the nature of humanitarian contexts and the structure of emergency response systems in order to professionally communicate plans and coordinate operations. Principles and models in this course are adapted to apply to different planning phases: disaster preparedness, emergency response, and protracted crisis.</p>\n<p>There is growing demand for humanitarian logistics professionals given increasing climate change, conflict, social vulnerability, and supply chain complexity.</p>\n<p>This course is designed to accommodate students from various backgrounds, including those with limited supply chain or humanitarian experience. It can be an avenue into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Social impact – humanitarian action makes direct impact through tangible operations</li>\n<li>Professional engagement – course knowledge enables you to professionally interact with humanitarian organizations such as the Red Cross, Doctors without Borders, Oxfam, Mercy Corps, and World Vision; United Nations agencies such as World Food Program (WFP), World Health Organization (WHO), and UNICEF; and national, regional, or local government emergency management agencies (e.g. FEMA), ministries or departments of public health and human services, and Centers for Disease Control (CDC).</li>\n<li>New careers – the course credential can open career opportunities in humanitarian roles such as operations/program analyst, supply chain manager, emergency manager, emergency planner, emergency program director, procurement assistant/officer, logistics assistant/officer, program assistant/officer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Experienced and mid-career supply chain professionals will enjoy learning how crisis contexts challenge your instincts in applying your skills toward humanitarian causes. Humanitarian response and emergency management professionals will gain a deeper understanding of how logistics systems work and learn how to collaborate with supply chain professionals in planning a more effective response.</p>\n<p>This course is created by the MIT Center for Transportation &amp; Logistics, which houses the #1 ranked MIT Supply Chain Management Master’s program, and which also offers the global MITx MicroMasters credential program in Supply Chain Management.</p>",

    "short_description": "The goal of the Climate Primer website is to summarize the most important lines of evidence for human-caused climate change. It confronts the stickier questions about uncertainty in our projections, engages in a discussion of risk and risk managment, and concludes by presenting different options for taking action. We hope that the facts prepare you for more effective conversations with your community about values, trade-offs, politics, and actions.\n\nIn March 2024, the MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative launched the first major update to the Climate Primer. The updated Primer includes more precise estimates of future global warming and its effects on global temperatures and extreme weather events, important advances in climate modeling, new actions taken around the world to adapt to the impacts of climate change, and the latest data about the pace at which clean energy and other critical climate solutions are being deployed. [Read more about the update on the MIT Environmental Solutions website](https://environmentalsolutions.mit.edu/news/a-refreshed-mit-climate-primer-to-better-serve-students-educators-and-the-climate-curious/).",

        "short_description": "The goal of the Climate Primer website is to summarize the most important lines of evidence for human-caused climate change. It confronts the stickier questions about uncertainty in our projections, engages in a discussion of risk and risk managment, and concludes by presenting different options for taking action. We hope that the facts prepare you for more effective conversations with your community about values, trade-offs, politics, and actions.\n\nIn March 2024, the MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative launched the first major update to the Climate Primer. The updated Primer includes more precise estimates of future global warming and its effects on global temperatures and extreme weather events, important advances in climate modeling, new actions taken around the world to adapt to the impacts of climate change, and the latest data about the pace at which clean energy and other critical climate solutions are being deployed. [Read more about the update on the MIT Environmental Solutions website](https://environmentalsolutions.mit.edu/news/a-refreshed-mit-climate-primer-to-better-serve-students-educators-and-the-climate-curious/).",

        "short_description": "Every day, teachers make thousands of decisions: what content to teach, what activities to assign, who to call on, how to respond to a student question, how to react to student behavior. These day-to-day decisions can have an enormous effect on the lives of young people, for good and ill. They can open new doors or cause lasting harm; they can make students feel seen and valued, or dampen their interest in school. In this course, we will investigate these interactions, rehearse responding to difficult scenarios, and develop a set of equity teaching mindsets and practices to support all of our learners, especially underserved students. \nWith colleagues from your school or organization and online learners around the world, you will participate in four cycles of inquiry, practice, and action, and then complete a final action project. In each cycle of inquiry, learners will examine and re-examine dimensions of inequality through educator mindsets, imagine community change through documentary case studies, rehearse taking action in thorny situations through digital practice spaces, and begin to lead change through action-oriented assignments. Our early investigations will focus on relationships and interactions with individual students, and pan out to examine the effects of bias on classrooms, schools, and communities. As you complete activities with peers online, you will develop a rich set of resources and exercises to use with your students and colleagues in your local context.\n At the end of the course, you will have a better understanding of yourself and your students, new resources to draw on for helping all students thrive, and an action plan for working in your school community to advance the lifelong work of equitable teaching.",

    "full_description": "<p>“Transformative Living Labs in Mobility” introduces living laboratory model of achieving sustainable urban mobility systems. The goal of the course is to explore the ways that multiple stakeholders and agencies organize and investigate living labs to find solutions for urban mobility.</p>\n<p>Mobility planning plays a key role in building more sustainable cities and providing equitable access to economic opportunities, education, healthcare and social activities. The living lab concept can be a helpful tool to achieve these goals.

They must be true leaders, motivators, and organizers, keeping all timelines, dependencies, and responsibilities on track. Modern project management theories are changing, and so are the industries that use them. This course presents an integrated framework for setting up organizations and projects for success while setting realistic expectations and commitments. Throughout the project lifecycle, project managers must process large amounts of information. Project management is rooted in gathering and organizing information. This process can be overwhelming, from collecting project requirements and setting up a team to tracking the project&#x27;s progress and reporting its financial status and value delivered. In this novel course, backed by MIT&#x27;s reputation as one of the world&#x27;s leading research institutions, participants will be able to design and manage complex technology projects holistically. The fundamental project management skills acquired in this course will empower them to become more effective project leaders.</p>",

However, bringing a medical device or drug to market is very different from building other kinds of products. Strict regulation also makes it a highly complex process. The MIT xPRO Drug and Medical Device Development: A Strategic Approach program is designed to provide you with a big picture view of initiating a medical drug or product development. It will also help you anticipate and address the complexities involved with developing medical products.</p>",

In fact, data engineer was the fastest growing tech occupation in 2020, according to the Dice Tech Job Report. Why? Because before data scientists can glean useful information from the mountains of data today’s organizations possess, the data must be architected, warehoused, and accessible, and data engineers are responsible for building this infrastructure. The MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Data Engineering is an immersive 6–month program that’s designed to provide job-ready, in-demand data engineering skills and a competitive edge in the marketplace.</p><p data-block-key=\"el5dv\"></p><p data-block-key=\"40l6k\">Developed in collaboration with Emeritus.</p>",

Many different analytical methods and techniques are used by researchers and practitioners alike to better design and manage their supply chains. This business and management course introduces the primary methods and tools that you will encounter in your study and practice of supply chains. We focus on the application of these methods, not necessarily the theoretical underpinnings.</p>\n<p>We will begin with an overview of introductory probability and decision analysis to ensure that students understand how uncertainty can be modeled. Next, we will move into basic statistics and regression. Finally, we will introduce optimization modeling from unconstrained to linear, non-linear, and mixed integer linear programming.</p>\n<p>This is a hands-on course. Students will use spreadsheets extensively to apply these techniques and approaches in case studies drawn from actual supply chains.</p>\n<p>SC0x is different from our other courses as it is self-paced and has a scheduled final exam. All material is made available during the second week, allowing learners to begin with any topic at their own convenience.</p>",
