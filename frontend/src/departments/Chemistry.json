You will explore the laws of thermodynamics and how they combine to establish the relationships between entropy, energy, work, and heat flow. You will then leverage these relationships to understand the nature of equilibrium and the forces that drive spontaneous transformations. You will then be introduced to the field of statistical mechanics, which formalizes the molecular scale origins of thermodynamic principles. Finally, you will leverage your understanding of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics to explore fundamental applications, including heat engines, calorimetry, and equilibrium in multi-component systems.</p>",

Together, the pair covers chemical thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, phase equilibria, and kinetics.</p>\n<p>In this course, you will leverage the ideas of entropy and free energy (previously developed in 5.601x) to describe chemical potential and how it relates to equilibrium. You will explore chemical equilibria between different chemical species and phase equilibria between different phases of the same chemical species, finally combining both to examine the multiple equilibria present in non-reactive mixtures of species.</p>\n<p>You will then change gears to focus on the evolution of chemical systems with time, exploring the concepts of kinetics. After appreciating links between molecular mechanisms and reaction dynamics, you will explore a variety of advanced topics, including catalysis, enzymatics, chain reactions, and oscillating chemical reactions.</p>\n<p>Based on the MIT undergraduate course 5.602 Thermodynamics II and Kinetics required of all Chemistry majors, this online version is best suited for learners with some knowledge of undergraduate general chemistry and multivariable calculus. However, any learner who wants to get an introduction to fundamental concepts in equilibrium and kinetics will benefit. We welcome undergraduate university students reviewing or supplementing their own course work, as well as mid-career professionals seeking to advance their careers or pursuing post-baccalaureate engineering and technology degrees.</p>",

    "short_description": "This course provides an introduction to the chemistry of biological, inorganic, and organic molecules. The emphasis is on basic principles of atomic and molecular electronic structure, thermodynamics, acid-base and redox equilibria, chemical kinetics, and catalysis. One year of high school chemistry is the expected background for this freshman-level course.\n\nThe aims include developing a unified and intuitive view of how electronic structure controls the three-dimensional shape of molecules, the physical and chemical properties of molecules in gases, liquids and solids, and ultimately the assembly of macromolecules as in polymers and DNA.

The final lectures cover applications to chemical bonding including valence bond and molecular orbital theory, molecular structure, spectroscopy.\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\n\nThe material for 5.61 has evolved over a period of many years, and, accordingly, several faculty members have contributed to the development of the course contents.

These were revised and transcribed to electronic form primarily by Prof. Keith A. Nelson. The current version includes additional contributions by Professors Moungi G. Bawendi, Robert W.
